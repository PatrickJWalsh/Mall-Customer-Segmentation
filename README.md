# Mall-Customer-Segmentation

### Source and Project Code 
This data was originally designed for Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z Course, though it can be found [here](https://github.com/PatrickJWalsh/Mall-Customer-Segmentation/blob/master/Mall%20Customer%20Clustering.R).  

### Project Introduction and Motivation
The dataset is a customer database of a mall.  It contains 200 observations with basic information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.  The purpose of this analysis is to uncover underlying patterns in the customer base, and to group them accordingly, often known as market segmentation.  In doing so, the marketing team can have a more targeted approach to reach consumers, and the mall can make more informed strategic decisions to drive profit. 

### Methods Used
All Analysis was performed in R.

* Exploratory Data Analysis and Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)

## Project Highlights
* Clustered data into 6 customer segments based on age, income, and spending score, facilitating targeted marketing to decrease customer acquisition cost and to increase customer retention
* Identified ideal segments to focus on given their potential lifetime value
* Recommended initiatives such as creating/revamping a loyalty program, optimizing the marketing mix, tailored promotions, and enhancing the in-store experience as levers to drive traffic and increase revenue

1)	The first cluster consists of younger shoppers who have moderate levels of income and spending score.  This cluster consists of people who can likely transition into more loyal customers given they are already frequent visitors who have a reasonable level of disposable income.  In-store promotions and a revamped loyalty program could incentivize this group to become higher spenders.  It helps that this cluster is young (mean age of 27), as reaching them shouldnâ€™t be difficult considering the majority of customers are under 40, so current marketing tactics are likely effective.
2)  The sixth cluster presents another interesting opportunity.  Accounting for nearly 17% of customers, this cluster represents high income, but low spending score individuals.  This group certainly has the financial means to spend more within the mall, however, they likely consume through other channels (other store outlets, online shopping), so more effort needs to be put towards getting them into the mall. Enhancing the in-store experience should help create a more viable alternative to their current purchasing outlets.  Stores with customer journeys that cannot be easily replicated online should take full advantage (such as fitting clothes in person, in-person demonstrations of technology, etc.)  Additionally, implementing click and collect and other features to expedite the ordering process can provide the convenience that this segment seeks.  Finally, a mean age of 42 communicates that this segment likely consists of parents of young children, so promotions and product offerings catered towards that demographic should be emphasized as well.  
3)	The second cluster is the largest, accounting for nearly 23% of customers.  Similar to the fourth cluster, this group possesses a moderate spending score and income, so they likely possess the means to spend more within the mall.  On the other hand, this demographic is older (mean of 56 years old), so the lifetime value of these customers may not be as high as the younger individuals in the same financial bracket.  That coupled with the fact that a different marketing mix would likely be used to reach this group means it is not necessarily the best use of resources.  Customer acquisition cost and expected lifetime value should be considerations here.  
4)	The fifth cluster is already the most loyal group, so increasing their spending will be difficult, but any initiatives towards other groups can only benefit this one as well.
5)	The third and fourth clusters are lower income individuals, and though the third cluster has a considerable spending score, these groups are the smallest segments and will have a tough time spending more money than they are already, so these groups are lower priority segments.
